# PHASE 1 - WEEK 3: CODE CHALLENGE

# Flatdango - Movie Ticket App

An application that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the theater

The app can:
- Show first movie's details i.e., poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets
- Show a menu of all movies on the left side of the page when the page loads
- Buy a ticket for a movie when button is clicked
- Replace the currently displayed movie's details with the new clicked movie's details
- Indicate that the movie is sold out by changing the button text to "Sold Out"
- Indicate that the movie is sold out on a list's film item
- Persist the updated number of `tickets_sold` on the server
- Delete a film from the server using the delete button on each film in the menu
